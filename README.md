# Snake Game

Recreated the famous snake game with python using the turtle module.

## Features

Control the snake with the arrow keys on your keyboard and collect food to gain points.

## Motivation

This is my first project that has a graphical user interface. 
Wanted to create a project to show my understanding of:

+ Implementing a GUI
+ Classes/Objects
+ Importing and using modules
+ Object-oriented programming

## Requirements

Python is required to run the main.py file

## Installation & Getting Started

Open the command prompt and enter the following:

    git clone https://github.com/Logan-proj/snake_game.git
    cd snake_game
